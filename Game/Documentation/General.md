### Overview
## Directories

# Code
This directory is where the bulk of the project will be located. It contains scripts, entities, scenes, 



# Documentation
This will be where information about implementation details will be. 
For projects without anyone else, this does not need to be particulaly long.
Documentation is important so that odd implementation details can be accounted for. 
Messy code that is dependent on other pieces of code should have their dependencies described, so that future efforts can result in a solution quicker.
Documentation will be organized according to directory structure, so finding details on a subject is easy to do.

# Plugins
This is where plugins will be stored. Keeping plugins organized and separate from the code base is good practice.

# Resources
This is where all assets, such as sprites, 3D models, textures, sound effects, music, and UI elements will be stored.
