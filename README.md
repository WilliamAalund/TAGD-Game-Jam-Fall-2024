# TAGD-Game-Jam-Fall-2024
Repository for my game that I will submit in the Fall Project 2024 Game Jam.

# Instructions

## Playing the game
In order to play the game, you can either:
1. Open the project in the Godot engine, and run the project.
OR
2. Run the excecutable applet in the Exports folder.

## If you have assets
If you have assets and don't know where to put them in the project, place them in the AssetDump folder. I (William) will organize and integrate them into the project myself.
